    "# 1 - Single population models \n",
    "\n",
    "## A first population model \n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim in this course is to model the dynamics of populations over time. By 'population' we simply mean some collection of individuals that are subject to the same underlying mechanisms. For example, we may consider the human population of Sheffield, or the tapir population of South America, or the maize crop population of a field in Nigeria. In later chapters we will move to smaller biological scales, considering perhaps less intuitive definitions of populations, such as of cells in the body, or proteins within cells. However, a key message to take from this course is that we can consider any and all biological populations in the same way from a modelling perspective, and subject to the same fundamental of biological mechanisms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will model these dynamics using *oridnary differential equations*, and our focus will be purely on how the size of a population varies over time. We will not consider where individuals are in space - this would likely require extending our methods to *partial differential equation* models, and plenty of excellent courses and textbooks can be found to explore such systems. When we talk about the 'size' of a population, we might think we mean the number of individuals in the population. However, as we will be using ordinary differential equations we need our variables to be continuous, not discrete. We will therefore instead keep track of a population's *density* - the number of individuals within some unit area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing our mathematical notation, we might call $N(t)$ the density of individuals within our population at time $t$. We now wish to write down an ordinary differential equation that describes its dynamics - that is what causes the population to increase or decrease. Our first modelling challenge, then, is to decide what mechanisms we should include. Using some biological intuition for the simplest possible population we can think of, we might expect our model to look something like,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{dN}{dt} &= \\textrm{births} -\\textrm{deaths}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to make any mathematical progress we will need to decide on functional forms for each of these mechanisms. This is another important modelling decision, and will depend on the specific biology. There are three main forms we might use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *constant rate*, $\\textrm{births}=B$. This would be suitable when new individuals appear in the environment at some constant rate, for example due to migration, or production of cells by the body.\n",
    "* *per-capita rate*,  $\\textrm{births}=bN$. This would be suitable when each individual produces offspring at a certain rate, such that there are more offspring produced when the population is larger.\n",
    "* *density-dependent rate*,  $\\textrm{births}=b(N)N$. This would be suitable if the per-capita rate is not fixed but instead varies with the population size, for example if high density means more competition for resources and thus lower growth. The form of this function will again depend on the biology, though there are common functions we tend to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our basic model, per-capita rates for birth and death seem the most obvious choice. Our model is thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{dN}{dt}&= bN - dN \\\\\n",
    "&= rN,\n",

    "\n",
    "## Limits to population growth: The logistic equation\n",
    "\n",
    "In that last exercise we found that if $r>0$ - meaning births are greater than deaths - our population will continue growing to infinitely large densities. This is, we can hopefully agree, a tad unrealistic. We should not lose heart at this point, though. A model that produces unrealistic results is still helpful to us, because it will point the way towards how we can develop an improved version. \n",
    "\n",
    "What might we have failed to take into account in our model? One answer is that as the population grows the environment will become limiting in some way. For example, individuals need space and nutrients to live and reproduce. These resources will be consumed by the population more and more as the population grows, likely leading to reduced birth and/or death rates. So while our assumptions may hold at low population densities, they will break down at higher densities. Our simple model has shown us that we need to take this into consideration if we are to understand the population dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given this, choosing a density-dependent growth rate starts to look like a better assumption. A relatively simple and intuitive way to set a limit on population growth is to assume that there is a fixed *carrying capacity* for the population, for example due to the available space or nutrients. We assume that as the population approaches this carrying capacity, the overall growth rate approaches zero, and once the population goes above this value the growth rate becomes negative. The simplest implementation of this is to assume that $r$ decreases linearly with $N$:\n",

    "## A useful step: non-dimensionalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "We can continue our analysis with the model in this form using methods for solving single ordinary differential equations. However, before continuing with our analysis we shall introduce the useful technique of *non-dimensionalising* our model. This is often - though not always - done to models to simplify some of the later working. It can both reduce the number of parameters in the model and give us insight in to the scales at which biological processes operate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Non-dimensionalisation involves combining variables and/or parameters from the model in biologically and mathematically helpful ways. For example, a natural scale for the population level is $K$, so we can define the non-dimensional population variable $n=N/K$ ($n$ is non-dimensional becaus eboth $N$ and $K$ have units 1/[density], so $n$ is a dimensionless number).

    "Spruce budworm is an insect that lives in spruce and fir forests in the USA and Canada. (This example is borrowed from the classic Mathematical Biology textbook by J. D. Murray, with a few tweaks). While they mostly exist at low numbers, there are periodic explosions of budworm populations that devestate the forests. Let us assume that on their own, the budworm populaitons follow the logistic growth model we have just studied. An additional feature of budworm dynamics is that they are predated by birds. We might then describe the dynamcis of budworm by the following equation,\n",

Should it be constant, a fixed per-capita rate, or some other density-dependent fucntion? First, we might reasonably assume that as more food becomes available, the more the birds will eat, so predation should increase with budworm density. However, we should also note that birds cannot eat an infinite amount, and that the rate of predation should therefore saturate at high budworm densities. We therefore need a density-dependent function. We might then give an explicit model as,\n",
