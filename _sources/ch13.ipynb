    "\n",
    "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects immune cells called 'CD4$^+$ T-cells', which form an important part of the human immune system. HIV enters these T-cells, begins to replicate and then releases new virus particles in to the bloodstream. Immediately after infection, the virus grows rapidly and produces flu-like symptoms in the patient. After a few months, these symptoms disappear and the virus concentration reduces to a lower, but steady, level. This 'asymptomatic period' can last for years, with the virus density staying roughly constant, and the concentration of T-cells very slowly dropping. Eventually, the T-cell density becomes so low that the patient's immune system is no longer effective, a condition called aquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The patient is then at risk from life-threatening opportunistic infections. In the mid-1990s, much work was being done to explore the dynamics of HIV and to produce potential treatments, including the development of mathematical models led by Perelson and Nelson. \n",

    "## A (pre-treatment) model\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the epidemic models, let's start by establishing our variables and drawing a schematic of what is happening in this system. The variables that we want to keep track of (before treatment, at least), are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Healthy T-cells ($T$)\n",
    "* Infected T-cells ($T^*$)\n",
    "* Virus particles ($V$)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only keep track of the concentration of virus particles in the bloodstream, not the 'intracellular' concentrations. Our schematic should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Healthy T-cells are produced at some constant rate $s$ by the body, but also decay at some rate $d$. These healthy cells become infected through contact with virus, in a mass-action manner, with coefficient $k$. These infected T-cells then decay at some rate $\\delta$. New virus particles are produced when infected T-cells die, with $N$ giving the average number of virus particles produced by each cell. The virus then also decays at some rate $c$. The system can therefore be expressed with the following set of ODEs:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{dT}{dt} &= s-dT-kVT\\label{hiv1}\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dT^*}{dt} &= kVT-\\delta T^*\\label{hiv2}\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dV}{dt} &= N\\delta T^*-cV\\label{hiv3}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the equations, we can see that there is an HIV-free equilibrium for $(T,T^*,V)=(s/d,0,0)$. We have another example here of a 3-dimensional system. As we saw in the free-living parasite model, assessing stability here can be a bit more complicated, often reying on using the *Routh-Hurwitz criteria*. As it turns out, for the HIV-free equilibrium things simplify fairly nicely to the point that we can actually directly calculate one of the eigenvalues, and then just use the trace-determinant conditions (themselves the Routh-Hurwitz criteria for a 2-dimensional system) to determine the sign of the other two.\n",

    "To find the eigenvalues we want to write out the *characteristic equation* - the determinant of the matrix of $ (J-\\lambda I_3)$, where $I_3$ is the identity matrix. The characteristic equation is,\n",

    "This is already partly factorised, making our life much easier. The first bracket tells us that one eigenvalue is $ \\lambda=-d\\lt0$. To find the remaining two eigenvalues we look at what is inside the square bracket, wich can be re-written as,\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "We could use the quadratic formula to solve for the eigenvalues explicitly, but we can also note that this is just the characteristic equation for a two dimensional system, with $ -(c+\\delta)$ being the trace and $ \\delta c-\\frac{ksN\\delta}{d}$ being the determinant. We can then see that we definitely have a negative trace, and that the determinant is positive - meaning the equilibrium is stable - if $ c\\gt ksN/d$. In other words, the decay rate of the virus must be high, and the infection rate and production rate must be low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, when a patient is to undergo treatment, they will not be HIV-free! We are therefore more interested in the pre-treatment infected steady-state. Setting the equations for $dT^*/dt$ and $dV/dt$ to zero, yields,\n",

    "Assume a patient arrives with their virus and T-cell concentrations at the pre-treatment steady state. We then wish to put them on a course of treatment. One of the most effective early treatments for HIV was using 'protease inhibitors'. These drugs did not prevent infection, but meant that any new virus produced inside infected T-cells were non-infectious. The system therefore becomes:\n",

    "In the early stages of treatment, it is reasonable for us to assume that the number of healthy T-cells stays roughly constant at it's pre-treatment level $T(t)=T_0$, so dT/dt can be ignored. We also know that before treatment, all virus particles were of the infective type, such that $V_I(0)=V_0$ and $V_{NI}(0)=0$. Given this, it is easy to show that,\n",
